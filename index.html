        <p>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML for short) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
        <p>HTML provides: <ul>
          <li>The text you read</li>
          <li>The layout of the webpage</li>
          <li>Accesibily features for screen readers</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS for short) is a stylesheet language used specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>CSS provides: <ul>
          <li>Background colors</li>
          <li>Font styles</li>
          <li>Simplified Webpage styling</li>
          <li>Site-wide consistancy</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>HTML uses elements to tell browsers what goes where. HTML documents start with a <code>!DOCTYPE html</code> element to let the browser know what language the document is written in. You can create a title using the <code>h1</code> element, which sets the text inside to the largest font size to show its importance. Webpages usually only have one of these.</p>
        <p><code>p</code> elements are used for paragraphs. A webpage can have as many <code>p</code> elements as is necessary. Other things HTML can do is make tables, buttons, form fields, and provide accessibility features for the visually impaired.</p>

        <p>As stated, styling is done using CSS. This is acheived by linking a stylesheet that has all the styling code you've created to an HTML document using the <code>link</code> element. In your stylesheet, you select the HTML elements that you want to style either by naming them directly, or by assigning a class or id to multiple elements that you want to group together.</p>
        <p>You can also use the same stylesheet accross a website so that every page is uniform; only having to make minor changes to account for different elements.</p>

        <p>Both HTML and CSS work together using specific elements and styling choices to provide a web page that is accessible to all. It is best practice to include tags for screen readers and to take visual impairment into account when building a web site.</p>
        <p>Some scroll types can cause discomfort for those with certain visual disabilities. For this reason, it is best to include a smooth scroll style. </p>
